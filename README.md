MOSGM-I: A phenomenological framework for environment-dependent gravity.

**Author:** Tarun Kumar Saxena

## Overview
This repository accompanies the arXiv preprint describing **MOSGM-I**, a
phenomenological framework that explores possible environment-dependent
modifications to gravitational dynamics at galactic scales.

The framework is intentionally conservative in scope and is designed to be
explicitly testable and falsifiable.
